      <CollapsibleContainer title="1. I can't see my funds. Did I just lose all my Danacho?">
          You probably didn't. It's very hard to simply 'lose' your tokens, since they are technically nowhere. Your coins 'live' on the blockchain and are linked to your account through a system of public and private keys secured by cryptography. That's why if you don't see your funds, it's probably because of a technical issue. Take a look at the 'Resources & Help' section at the top of this page for a list of useful resources that will help you identify and fix your problem.

        <CollapsibleContainer title="5. How does Danacho have value?">
        Danacho has value because people are willing to buy it. If no one is willing to buy Danacho, then it will not have any value. Danachoâ€™s price increases if demand exceeds supply, and it decreases if supply exceeds demand.
